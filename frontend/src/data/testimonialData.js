      "As first time parents of a spirited toddler, we can’t say enough good things about our experience with Emi. From the very beginning she made us feel completely at ease, snapping beautiful, candid moments of us just enjoying the outdoors together. She brought along baby toys that instantly won over our daughter, which made such a difference in helping her feel comfortable and happy. What really stood out to me was how natural everything felt. She has this incredible gift for blending professionalism with a personal touch. We can tell she genuinely cares about the families she photographs. Thanks, Emi! We now have a collection of heartfelt, joy-filled images that we’ll treasure for the rest of our lives.",

      '"Emi is an absolute gift! Our family photo session with you was nothing short of magical. Your sweet, warm personality instantly put us at ease. My one and a half year old son was so smitten with you that he let you carry him and was more affectionate than he is with most people. That alone speaks to the special energy you bring! You made the whole experience feel so natural and effortless, like you were just a friend hanging out with us, capturing our joy without ever intruding on the moment. Your kindness and personable nature made it such a delight to work with you. And when we saw the photos? Oh, Emi, they took my breath away. Your talent is truly remarkable. The way you captured my son’s spark and our family’s love was beyond anything I could have imagined. It’s rare to find someone who’s not only so skilled at their craft but also so genuinely good hearted. Emi, you’re a treasure, and we can’t wait to work with you again. Thank you for giving us memories we’ll cherish forever!"',

      '"We recently had the pleasure of having candid family photos taken by Emi at the UC Davis Arboretum, near the horses—and the experience was absolutely wonderful. She has such a natural eye for capturing genuine moments, and every photo reflects the love and connection in our little family. The setting was perfect, but it was truly her talent and calming presence that made the session feel so natural and like us. On top of that, her turnaround time was incredibly fast, and we were blown away by the quality of the final images. We will cherish these photos forever. I can’t recommend her enough!"',
